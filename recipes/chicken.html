        General Tso's (pronounced tsow) chicken is a Chinese-American dish that 
        features deep-fried chicken tossed in an irresistibly sticky glaze made 
        with garlic, sugar, soy sauce, and chiles. The dish is named after 19th-century
         military leader Tso Tsung-t'ang.

            <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
             
            <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>

    </ul>

    <br>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in large mixing bowl. Add chicken, salt, sugar, and pepper; mix well. Mix in cornstarch, a little bit at a time, until chicken is well coated.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, carefully drop one piece of chicken at a time into the hot oil. Fry until chicken turns golden brown and begins to float, about 3 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and allow to cool as you fry the next batch.</li>
        <li>Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked first. Fry each batch until chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in green onion, garlic, whole chiles, and orange zest. Cook and stir until garlic turns golden and chiles brighten, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, peanut oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in water until dissolved. Stir into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook until chicken is heated through and has absorbed some of the sauce, about 3 minutes.</li>
        
    </ol>
