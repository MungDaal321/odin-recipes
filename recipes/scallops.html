        This delicious appetizer is prepared quickly and easily in the air fryer and served with a spicy Sriracha mayo dipping sauce. I use the smaller bay scallops for this. If you are using jumbo scallops it will require a longer cooking time and longer strips of bacon.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound bay scallops (about 36 small scallops)</li>
        <li>1 pinch coarse salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>12 slices bacon, cut into thirds</li>
        <li>1 serving olive oil cooking spray</li>
       
    </ul>
    
    <br>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise and Sriracha sauce together in a small bowl. Refrigerate Sriracha mayo until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread scallops out onto a plate or cutting board and blot dry with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper. Wrap each scallop with 1/3 slice of bacon and secure with a toothpick.</li>
        <li>Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place bacon-wrapped scallops in the basket in a single layer; split into 2 batches if necessary.</li>
        <li>Cook in the air fryer for 7 minutes. Check for doneness; scallops should be opaque and bacon should be crispy. Cook 1 to 2 minutes longer, if necessary, checking every minute. Remove scallops carefully with tongs and place on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil from the bacon. Serve with Sriracha mayo.</li>
    </ol>
